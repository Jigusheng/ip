# Console UI test plan

Each test case runs in a fresh Lumi process and an isolated temporary working folder. Expected response blocks correspond to the input commands in order and are separated by a line containing only `---`. The test runner checks the surrounding divider lines separately. A case can provide `Initial data` to prepare its data file and `Expected data` to check the final saved records.

## TC-01: Mixed task types and status changes

Aim: Verify that to-dos, deadlines, and events are added polymorphically and retain their type-specific display when marked and unmarked.

### Inputs

```text
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by 2019-10-15
event project meeting /from 2019-10-16 1400 /to 2019-10-16 1600
mark 1
list
unmark 1
list
bye
```

## TC-02: Parsed deadline dates and times

## TC-07: Load and automatically save tasks

Aim: Verify valid saved tasks and statuses load at startup, a malformed line is skipped, and each kind of successful list mutation is reflected in the final data file.

### Initial data

```text
T | 1 | read book
D | 0 | return book | 2019-06-06T00:00:00
this line is corrupted

## TC-08: Find tasks by description

Aim: Verify that find requires a separate non-empty keyword, matches description substrings case-insensitively across task types, renumbers matches, shows no results cleanly, and does not change task state.
